    <p class="textbox" style="font-size: 22px;">The UN International Convention on Road Traffic states that, according to Article 8, paragraph 1, "every vehicle and interconnected vehicles, when in motion, must have a driver." 
        Therefore, autonomous vehicles are bound by the UN Convention in states that have signed it, and in those, self-driving cars are not yet allowed, but driver assistance systems have been allowed since 2014. 
        However, in states like the U.S. and China, autonomous vehicles are permitted on the roads because they are not subject to the UN Convention. 
        Probably the two most advanced countries in autonomous driving are Germany and the US. However, there was until May 2021 of the problem with the UN Convention, but since May 2021, autonomous vehicles are allowed on the roads in Germany.
         According to forecasts, from 2030, then cars with City pilot, that is, the ability to drive alone both on the highway and in the city, will gradually appear on the roads. 
         And it will not be until after 2040 that cars will be available in larger numbers that are fully autonomous from door to door, i.e., that no longer require a driver even on rural roads.
