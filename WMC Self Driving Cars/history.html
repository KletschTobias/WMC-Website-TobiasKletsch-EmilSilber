    <p class="textbox" style="font-size: 22px;">The first test attempts to self-driving cars already existed in the early 20th century. In 1925 there was the so-called "American Wonder". This automobile was 
        steered by radio impulses. To do this, another car must follow behind and send 
        radio impulses to the self-driving car. The era of autonomous cars began in the 1960s with the Stanford Cart. 
        The analysis of camera images taken during movement took place on a 
        stationary computer connected by radio. In the 1980s, Mercedes-Benz developed the robotic van. It was developed by Ernst Dickman and his team. Ernst Dickman is 
        considered one of the pioneers of autonomous driving. In the 1990s, autonomous vehicles were first 
        developed for the military. Until the late 2010s, autonomous vehicles were mainly developed and used for the military. Since 2016, major advances in autonomous driving have been made annually. One of the biggest visionaries for self-driving cars is Elon Musk 
        with his Tesla cars, but many other car companies such as Honda, Volvo or even Mercedes-Benz have also achieved a lot in the field of autonomous driving.
